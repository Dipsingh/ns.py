# NetworkSim: A Discrete-Event Network Simulator using Python

This discrete-event network simulator is based on [`simpy`](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a general-purpose discrete event simulation framework for Python. It is designed to be flexible and reusable. It can be used connect multiple networking components together easily, including packet generators, switch elements, traffic shapers, schedulers, and demultiplexing elements.

New components will be added over time. Try some examples in the `examples/` directory. It would be a good idea to add more examples whenever new components are introduced.
