# ns.py: A Pythonic Discrete-Event Network Simulator

This discrete-event network simulator is based on [`simpy`](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a general-purpose discrete event simulation framework for Python. `ns.py` is designed to be flexible and reusable, and can be used to connect multiple networking components together easily, including packet generators, network links, switch elements, schedulers, traffic shapers, traffic monitors, and demultiplexing elements.

New components will be added over time. Try some examples in the `examples/` directory. It would be a good idea to add more examples whenever new components are introduced.
